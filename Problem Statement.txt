Problem Statement:
Psoriasis is a long-lasting autoimmune disease which is characterized by patches of abnormal skin.[3] These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis is generally thought to be a genetic disease which is triggered by environmental factors. Classic genome-wide linkage analysis has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9)

Now you are given four fasta files having nucleotide sequences that are associated Psoriasis at different loci. You are required to compare these four sequences (comparison of A,T,C and G count, protein sequence/Amino Acids) and try to depict the comparison graphically.(Hint: use count function of BioPython)

Bonus: Using the above comparison try to find out the genetic mutation that lead to Psoriasis and why the mutation at one of the nine loci may lead to Psoriasis. Do we have any relation between the nine loci as mutation among them leads to the same disease?
